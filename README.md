## Overview

DHEU Ocean Watch is an advanced web-based platform developed for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025** under the challenge theme: *"Through the Radar Looking Glass: Revealing Earth Processes with SAR"*. The system leverages Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and multi-source satellite imagery to provide comprehensive, real-time ocean health monitoring and environmental accountability.

By integrating data from NASA Earth, MODIS, and ASF, DHEU Ocean Watch quantifies ocean health through a proprietary metric,the **SARgonauts Index**- enabling researchers, policymakers, and citizens to track marine environmental conditions with unprecedented accessibility and precision.

### Mission Statement

We are not just monitoring the ocean, we are giving it a voice. DHEU Ocean Watch serves as the bridge between the silent suffering of marine ecosystems and the urgent need for global awareness and action.

## Problem Statement

Marine ecosystems face critical threats from pollution, climate change, and human activity. Current monitoring systems suffer from:

- **Limited Accessibility**: Complex scientific data remains confined to research institutions
- **Delayed Response**: Environmental incidents often go undetected until irreversible damage occurs
- **Accountability Gap**: Lack of public transparency in marine environmental governance
- **Data Fragmentation**: Multiple data sources exist without unified interpretation
- **Communication Barrier**: Scientific findings fail to reach policymakers and the general public effectively

### The Reality We Face

Marine waste is choking our seas. Oil slicks are poisoning marine life. Temperature and salinity levels are rising, disrupting ecosystems from surface to depths. Yet accountability remains absent, and action is delayed until damage becomes irreversible.

DHEU Ocean Watch addresses these challenges by democratizing ocean health data and enabling immediate public awareness and policy response.

## Core Features

### 1. **Home - Mission Gateway**
Provides visitors with a comprehensive understanding of our mission, the urgency of ocean conservation, and the technological approach we employ to monitor and protect marine environments.

### 2. **Dashboard - Real-Time Ocean Health Monitoring**
The beating heart of our system, featuring:

- **SARgonauts Index**: Proprietary scoring system (0-100) integrating seven critical parameters:
  - Sea level anomalies
  - Ocean color indices
  - Wave frequency patterns
  - Oil slick detection
  - Marine waste accumulation
  - Salinity variations
  - Sea surface height deviations
- Regional analysis with granular geographic resolution
- Historical trend visualization and comparative analytics
- Instant health status classification for any monitored region

### 3. **Simulator - Environmental Impact Visualization**
Where science meets storytelling:

- Interactive time-lapse simulations demonstrating environmental changes
- Coral bleaching prediction models based on temperature anomalies
- Ocean current disruption analysis from salinity changes
- Live simulations showing data in action
- Intuitive severity scaling with actionable thresholds
- Visual demonstration of how "bad" becomes "catastrophic"

### 4. **Updates - Advocacy and Action Platform**
Transforming data into action:

- Automated generation of policy recommendations aligned with UNDP and FAO frameworks
- Region-specific open letters to governmental authorities and policymakers
- Social media integration for public accountability campaigns
- Evidence-based documentation for environmental incidents
- Direct pressure mechanisms for authorities through user-shared content
- Conditional content generation: celebratory messages for good indices, urgent action plans for concerning data

### 5. **DheuKids - Educational Outreach**
Educating the next generation:

- Age-appropriate content explaining ocean conservation principles
- Simple, engaging explanations of why oceans matter
- Interactive learning modules for young environmental stewards
- Accessible scientific concepts for children

### 6. **Team Section**
